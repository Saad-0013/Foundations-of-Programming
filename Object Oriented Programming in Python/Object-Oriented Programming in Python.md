# Object Oriented Programming in Python

## Types of Programming

1. Prodcedural Programming
    - Code as a sequence of steps
    - Mostly used for data analysis and scripts

2. Object Oriented Programming
    - Code as interaction of objects
    - Mostly for bulding frameworks and tools
    - More easy to maintain and reusable

## Objects v/s Classes

1. Objects as data structures

    - Data structure that encorporates information about
        - state
        - behavior

    - Customer Object
        - <b>can have - States</b>
