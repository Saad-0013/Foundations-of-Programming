# Object Oriented Programming in Python

## Types of Programming

1. Prodcedural Programming
    - Code as a sequence of steps
    - Mostly used for data analysis and scripts

2. Object Oriented Programming
    - Code as interaction of objects
    - Mostly for bulding frameworks and tools
    - More easy to maintain and reusable

## Objects v/s Classes

1. Objects as data structures

    - Data structure that encorporates information about
        - state
        - behavior

    - Customer Object
        - <b>can have - States</b> 
            - email 
            - phone number

        - <b>can perform the acts of - Behavior</b>
            - placing order
            - cancel order
        
    - <b><u>Example</u></b>
        - A button having a label (state) and pressing it can trigger an event (behavior). 

    - Everything in Python is an object.
    
2. Classes

<b>Classes</b> can be thought of as blueprints for objects outlining possible states and behavior.

Defining a class for a customer object, means each customer will have a phone number and an email. In this way we can talk about all the customers in a unified way.


## Encapsulation

For an object, <b>State</b> and <b>Behavior</b> are bundelled together. 

- A Customer Object has:
    - data
    - actions

Think of data and actions as a single unit representing a customer object. Not as seperate units.

## ATTRIBUTES v/s METHODS


<b>State</b> information is contained in <b>Attributes</b>.
<b>Behavior</b> information is contained in <b>Methods</b>.

### Examples
<b>Attribute:</b> a.shape
<b>Method:</b> a.reshape()
